# GEN AI chatbot

## Introduction
------------
This project introduces a novel voice-based chatbot that leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) and external data sources to answer user inquiries. 
The core engine is an LLM from Hugging Face, enabling the chatbot to understand natural language questions and provide informative answers. 
LangChain, a conversational AI framework, manages the conversation flow, ensuring smooth interaction and context awareness. Streamlit facilitates a user-friendly 
interface for voice interaction. 

Additionally, the chatbot integrates with the Elevenlabs API, allowing it to convert voice to text and generate spoken responses. 
Finally, the system extracts information from provided PDFs, expanding its knowledge base and offering a richer user experience. 
This project bridges the gap between traditional document analysis and voice interaction, creating a user friendly and informative platform for knowledge seekers.
